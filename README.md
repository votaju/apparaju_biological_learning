## Files
- NN_with_end_to_end_backprop.ipynb: Neural Network with a single hidden layer trained for classification tasks using classic end-to-end backpropagation.
- Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_MNIST.ipynb: Dmitry Krotov's provided unsupervised learning algorithm based on numpy. Accentuated with cells to debug and understand workings of the algorithm.
- unsupervised_bio_learning_pytorch.ipynb: Apparaju's implementation of unsupervised learning algorithm based on numpy and pytorch. Based on Dmitry's provided code referenced above. Makes use of GPU (cuda) if available.


The below part of the README is pasted from Krotov's Github: https://github.com/DimaKrotov/Biological_Learning which was used as a starting point for the project.

# Biological_Learning
Example of "biological" learning for MNIST based on the paper [Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820458116) by D.Krotov and J.Hopfield. If you want to learn more about this work you can also check out this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lY-oAY0aQU) from MIT's [6.S191 course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).  

## Getting started

install jupyter notebook and numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
run `Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_MNIST.ipynb` and observe weights.
